1. How do we understand public money? (Data)

--
 
2. Where does public money come from? (Revenue)

--
 
3. How is public money spent? By whom? (Spending)

# What is a budget?

---
class: large


A plan

An expression of collective decisions

A solution to collective action problems

An accountability tool

---
class: inverse, middle


# What else can we know about public money

---
class: large

# Think stocks and flows

Budgets v. P&L x balance sheets

= What is raised/spent v. what is owned and owed

---
class: large

# Think principals and agents: who accounts to whom

Spenders to finance ministry

Executive to legislature

Supreme Audit Institutions

Member states <-> EU

---
class: large

# Think ex ante and ex post accountability

budgets as plans vs. accounts as records of what happened

Accounting and economics concepts/language can clash

Accountability => data is generated!
